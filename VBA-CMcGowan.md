Visual Basic for Applications
=============================

**Introduction**

This essay will look at how VBA can be used with Excel to create a powerful tool for problem solving and analytics in data.

From some research, looking at job boards etc., it is clear that exposure to VBA is something that employers find very attractive.

Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an implementation of Microsoft's discontinued event-driven programming language, Visual Basic 6, and its associated integrated development environment (IDE).

VBA is a powerful and time-saving tool for automating processes which could take hours to manually process. It is for this reason why employers look to it so favourably.

The most used application in conjunction with VBA is Microsoft Excel.

**What is VBA for Excel?**

Visual Basic for Applications enables building user-defined functions (UDFs), automating processes and accessing Windows API and other low-level functionality through dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). 

It supersedes and expands on the abilities of earlier application-specific macro programming languages such as Word's WordBasic. 

It can be used to control many aspects of the host application, including manipulating user interface features, such as menus and toolbars, and working with custom user forms or dialog boxes.

VBA works by running macros, step-by-step procedures written in Visual Basic. Many users find that learning even a small amount of VBA code makes their work easier and gives them the ability to do things in Office that they did not think were possible. Once you have learned some VBA, it becomes much easier to learn a whole lot moreâ€”so the possibilities here are limitless.

**VBA as both a complier and an interpreter**

Traditional compiled languages, such as C, compile human-readable source code into machine-readable, and much faster, object code. These object programs then need to be linked into an executable file to be used. Syntax errors are not generally located until the code is completely compiled. (Parsing compilers are an exception.) 

Traditional interpreted languages, such as QBasic, use interpreters that read each line of code and translate it into computer instructions as you write it. An advantage of this method is that an interpreter can test your code as you write it. In some cases this line-by-line interpretation can be slow. 

Visual Basic incorporates elements of both compiled and interpreted languages. Visual Basic does interpret each line of code as you write it, but Microsoft Access performs this interpretation in the background, and does not exhibit any performance degradation because of this interpretation.

**The Visual Basic Editor in Excel (VBE)**

When you want Excel to do some work for you, you open the Visual Basic Editor and you write the instructions in the VBA language that Excel understands.

You develop, test and modify VBA procedures (macros) in the Excel Visual Basic Editor (VBE). It is a very user-friendly development environment. VBA procedures developed in the VBE become part of the workbook in which they are developed and when the workbook is saved the VBA components are saved at the same time. So, when you send the workbook to the "Recycling Bin" the VBA procedures (macros) are destroyed.
