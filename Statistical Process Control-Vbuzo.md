Quality Control Today
########################

In this era of strains on the resources and rising costs of manufacturing, it becomes
increasingly apparent that decisions must be made on facts, not just opinions.
Consequently, data must be gathered and analyzed. This is where *statistical process
control (SPC)* comes in. For over 70 years, the manufacturing arena has benefited from
the tools of SPC that have helped guide the decision-making process. In particular, the
control chart has helped determine whether special-cause variation is present implying
that action needs to be taken to either eliminate that cause if it has a detrimental effect on
the process or to make it standard operating procedure if that cause has a beneficial
effect on the process. If no special-cause variation is found to be present, SPC helps
define the capability of the stable process to judge whether it is operating at an
acceptable level.
The **strength of SPC** is its simplicity. And with the use Statit on the computer to make the
calculations and to plot the charts, the simplicity becomes complete.

New Demands On Systems Require Action
Accountability with hard data, not fuzzy opinions, is being demanded. Existing processes
must be examined and new ones discovered. The good news is that improved quality
inherently lowers costs as it provides a better product and/or service. ***Statistical Process
Control*** provides accountability and is an essential ingredient in this quality effort.
