Control Charts
========================================

Control Charts are tools broadly used in processes that require monitoring in order to understand their characteristics and behaviors. From the process target, deviations might occur and when they do so they might be detected, analyzed and treated. Those deviations might be analyzed under statistical metrics that takes into consideration evidences of statistical significance. As a basic principle, any process is subject to random variations, which most of the times are not controllable or identifiable thus within limits, some variation is allowed (Xie,   ).

It is necessary to understand how these tools work so that their characteristics and potential become understandable. Run chart is a scatter graphic in which a succession of measurements are plotted versus the time order in which they happen. The data points are connected by lines that enable the recognition of patterns, which otherwise would not be visible. In order to highlight where the process center, a line might be drawn. In other words, this line is positioned exactly where the process mean is and thus where the process target is. Specification limits are externally specified, for example, by the customer. They are two and are named USL (Upper Specification Limit) and LSL (Lower Specification Limit). 

 Measurements that fall outside those limits are considered unacceptable thus rejected. The ideas above do not necessarily need to be used just in manufacturing processes but also in services such as queues in banks, number of complaints, delivery times among many other situations.
 
Regarding the process stability, it will be considered stable if the distribution of X does not change over the time. To check this, imagine you taking pictures from a process in approximately the same timeframe. If they distributions look like similar then the process is stable. The stability is our ally when we want to forecast the variation in our product in the future and then enables us to develop systems that can deal with this level of variability. Thereby, stability makes us capable of setting up a forward planning (Wild,  ).
