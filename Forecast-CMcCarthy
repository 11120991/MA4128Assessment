# Forecasting

Forecasting involves extrapolating a fitted model into the future by evaluating the model function over a given range of 
observations in time. The main problem is that the trends present in the fitted series may change in the future. Therefore it
may be more appropriate to think of a forecast as an expected value conditional on past trends continuing in the future.

Forecasting methods can be of particular use in the field of economics for example. It's conceivable that time-series analysis
can be a somewhat useful tool to generate forecasts for the exchange rate, to take a particular example. Based on historical data we can
attempt to identify underlying trends in the movements of exchange rates and attempt to predict future values based on such analysis. A
particular branch of time-series analysis that may fit this context would be Smoothing Models, more specifically Exponential Smoothing
Models. Exponential Smoothing assigns a decreasing weight to observations as they get older. Therefore more recent observations are
assigned a greater importance compared to older observations. Which with respect to exchange rates would seem to be intuitive as current
fluctuations in the market would take precedent over much more dated movements. The smoothing technique can have the effect of reducing
seemingly random variationin data collected, thus revealing the underlying trend in the data with more clarity.
