Network Analysis
=========================
Network Analysis is the general name given to certain specific techniques which can be used for the planning, management and control of projects. **A project is a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a "unique" product or service.**

Two different techniques for Network Analysis were developed in the late 1950's and these were: 
- PERT (for program evaluation and review technique) 
- CPM (for Critical Path Management)

Pert was developed to aid the US Navy in the planning and control of its Polaris missile program.
