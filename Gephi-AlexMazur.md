####History note

  The history of graphical data representation is said to begin in **1786**, when `William Playfair`, published the first presentation graphics. With the invention of computers stronger graphic tools became available for solving the scientific problems *"However, in its early days the lack of graphics power often limited its usefulness. The recent emphasis on visualization started in 1987 with the special issue of Computer Graphics on Visualization in Scientific Computing. Since then there have been several conferences and workshops, co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and ACM SIGGRAPH"*.
