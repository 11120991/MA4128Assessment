####History note

  The history of graphical data representation is said to begin in **1786**, when `William Playfair`, published the first presentation graphics. With the invention of computers stronger graphic tools became available for solving the scientific problems *"However, in its early days the lack of graphics power often limited its usefulness. The recent emphasis on visualization started in 1987 with the special issue of Computer Graphics on Visualization in Scientific Computing. Since then there have been several conferences and workshops, co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and ACM SIGGRAPH"*. 
  
####Insight: *Data Visualisation* 

  Data Visualisation refers to the movement originating from satistics and highly relevan to big data. This aims to transform the massive tables of data into the intuitive media, which is graphs and diagrams. The latter is easily understood and can be communicated to a wider audience. In fact, effective visualization helps users analyze and reason about data and evidence more efficiently as it makes data less complex. It is suitable for analytical tasks such as making comparisons or understanding causality and will usually be designed to fit a particular task. For instance a table is a simple form of visualisation, which is used very commonly for reference, while various charts will show patterns in data, relationships and distributions. However data visualisation is only one of the ways to analyse data and present it to users.Grahical displays should:
- show the data
- induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, the technology of graphic production or something else
- avoid distorting what the data has to say
- present many numbers in a small space
- make large data sets coherent
- encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data
- reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to the fine structure
- serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation or decoration
- be closely integrated with the statistical and verbal descriptions of a data set.
