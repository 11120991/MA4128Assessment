###Computer Graphics

Pat Hanrahan was also a founding member of **Pixar** in the 1980s. This project transformed the world of animated film. Hanrahan has received three Academy Awards for his work in computer graphics. He was awarded in 2014 a Technical Achievement Oscar for his formalisation and reference implementation of the concepts behind physically based rendering, as shared in their book Physically Based Rendering. In 2004, Hanrahan was awarded another Technical Achievement Oscar, together with Stephen R. Marschner and Henrik Wann Jensen, for pioneering research in simulating subsurface scattering of light in translucent materials as presented in their paper "A Practical Model for Subsurface Light Transport.". Nearly a decade earlier, Hanrahan and other Pixar founding employees were awarded a Scientific and Engineering Oscar, for development of "RenderMan" software providing the means to digitally create scenes or elements that may be composited with other footage.


###Tableau and Business

Tableau is business intelligence (BI) software that allows anyone to easily connect to data, then visualize and create interactive dashboards that they can securely share online with others in a matter of seconds. It's so simple to use that Tableau themselves claim that any Excel user can learn it, but powerful enough to solve even the most complex analytical problems. 

Tableau also claim to be a much more efficient, scalable and easily deployable business intelligence tool than others. They emphasize this as they believe it is what today's organisations need in order to accomplish their goals. Often introducing a new BI tool is an effort of weeks, months or even years and maintenance is neverending. Installing Tableau Desktop only takes minutes and once it's installed, anyone can connect to big data with a click and create interactive, analytical dashboards. Sharing dashboards is just as easy. 


###The Future of Tableau

According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) by 2020 the world will generate 50 times the amount of data as it did in 2011. And will have 75 times the number of information sources. Tableau believes this is a huge opportunity for human advancement but for this data to offer benefits humans must have it at their fingertips. Tableau is building software to deliver exactly that. They make analyzing data fast, easy and useful.
