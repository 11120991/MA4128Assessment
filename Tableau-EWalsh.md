###Computer Graphics

Pat Hanrahan was also a founding member of Pixar in the 1980s. This project transformed the world of animated film. Hanrahan has received three Academy Awards for his work in computer graphics. He was awarded in 2014 a Technical Achievement Oscar for his formalisation and reference implementation of the concepts behind physically based rendering, as shared in their book Physically Based Rendering. In 2004, Hanrahan was awarded another Technical Achievement Oscar, together with Stephen R. Marschner and Henrik Wann Jensen, for pioneering research in simulating subsurface scattering of light in translucent materials as presented in their paper "A Practical Model for Subsurface Light Transport.". Nearly a decade earlier, Hanrahan and other Pixar founding employees were awarded a Scientific and Engineering Oscar, for development of "RenderMan" software providing the means to digitally create scenes or elements that may be composited with other footage.
