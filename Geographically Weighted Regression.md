Geographically Weighted Regression.
===================================


In this essay I will provide some information about Geographically Weighted Regression which is excellent tool for testing model specification.
To understand (GWR) and its methodology we should know regression and spatial analysis. At the beginning the aim of data analysis is to provide relationship between two variables.

### Regression.
Actually, ***regression*** is the most common type to obtain this aim. *If* we want to define regression, we will say is the statistical measure that attempts to determine relationship between one dependent variable and many others changing variables.

### Spatial Analysis
In spatial analysis the data pulled from geographical units and a single regression equation is estimated we assume a stationary process. What is happening has an impact in producing average or global parameter estimates.
