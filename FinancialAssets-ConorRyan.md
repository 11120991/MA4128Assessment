## Options:
Options are derivative contracts written against an underlying asset. They come in four flavours depending whether they are calls or puts, and depending on whether they are short or long.
There are many different types of options available on the market. The most basic type of options are called Vanilla options. Vanilla options consist of calls and puts. An option is known as a European option if it can only be exercised on the expiration date. An option is known as an American option can be exercised at any point up to the expiration date. The more complex options are known as exotic options. 
To understand how investors use these options, consider a European call option in which one has the right to buy 100 shares at €10 with maturity in one year. If at maturity, the stock price is €12, the option will be exercised. The investor will buy the 100 shares for €1000 and immediately sell these on the market at €12 a share making a profit of €200.
The different types of exotic options include forward-start options, the Cliquet option, Asian option and Barrier option. The holder or owner of the option is said to have a long position. The writer of the option is said to have a short position
## Bonds:
Bonds are paper issued by governments, corporations etc.A bond has a maturity date T. A bond has a principal or  face value eV. We will usually take this to be 100 euro. On the maturity date the holder of the bond is paid the face value V euro. For a zero-coupon bond, this is the only payment. For a coupon bond, the bearer is paid coupons of a fixed amount, usually semi-annually, up to maturity. The coupon rate is the sum of the coupons payments paid in a year divided by the face value. The PV of a bond will usually not be its face value. A bond may be traded at any time up to its maturity. The value of a bond will change as interests rates change. If interest rates rise, bond prices fall; if interest rates fall, bond prices increase. The credit rating of a corporation can affect corporate bond prices. If a corporation defaults, only a fraction of the face value will be repaid
