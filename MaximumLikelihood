In statistics, maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model given data.
The method of maximum likelihood corresponds to many well-known estimation methods in statistics. 
For example, one may be interested in the heights of adult female penguins, but be unable to measure the height of every single penguin in a population due to cost or time constraints. 
Assuming that the heights are normally distributed with some unknown mean and variance, the mean and variance can be estimated with MLE while only knowing the heights of some sample of the overall population. 
MLE would accomplish this by taking the mean and variance as parameters and finding particular parametric values that make the observed results the most probable given the model.
