Analysing Twitter Data with Neo4j
======================================

Neo4j is an open-source graph database implemented in Java and accessible from software written in other languages using the Cypher Query Language through a transactional HTTP endpoint. It is a ver popular graph database. It has been described an ACID-compliant transactional database with native graph storage and processing. Neo4j was orgially released in February, 2010, and the company ia based in the San Francisco Bay Area, US and Malm√∂, Sweden.

There are many uses of Neo4j, and graph databases in general. I will now discuss several applications of using graph databases, specifically Neo4j, in order to analyse and store data.

** Master Data Management
The world of master data is changing. Data architects and application developers are swapping their relational databases with graph databases to store their master data. This switch enables them to use a data store optimized to discover new insights in existing data, provide a 360-degree view of master data and answer questions about data relationships in real time. Business gain the benefit of real time insights into data, along with a place to store and model their data. Some challenges that can stem from this, however, are:
* **Complex and Hierarchical Datasets** are quite difficult to manage in this state. The code is difficult to build, slow to run and expensive and time-consuming to maintain.
