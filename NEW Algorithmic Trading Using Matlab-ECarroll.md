Algorithmic Trading Using Matlab
=========================================

####Introduction

MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation. Matlab was originally written by Cleve Moler, chairman of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico in 1970â€™s, to provide easy access to matrix software developed by the LINPACK and EISPACK for his students. Recognizing its commercial potential Jack Little, an engineer from Stamford, joined Moler to develop the language and interface into what it is today.

The programming environment was first adopted by researchers and practitioners in control engineering, Little's specialty, but quickly spread to many other domains such as data analysis, problem solving, and for experimentation and algorithm development. It is now also heavily used in education, in particular the teaching of linear algebra, numerical analysis, and is popular amongst scientists involved in image processing. Its influence in education is confirmed by the fact that more than 1000 textbooks use MATLAB as a teaching vehicle.

Over the years discipline-specific software written in MATLAB which is organized into libraries of functions called ***toolboxes***, are widely used as well, a particular advantage for algorithmic trading with MATLAB. These *toolboxes* are simply add-ons to the basic package subscription some example of which are *Statistics*, and *Global Optimization*, *Financial* and *Trading* toolboxes. The Financial toolbox in particular is of great use for developing algorithms and testing them in MATLAB. The toolbox provides functions such as *sde()*, *ftsbound()* and *corrcoef()* for mathematical modelling and statistical analysis of financial data. The toolbox has the following features:
* Portfolio Optimization 
* Risk and Investment Analysis 
* Financial Time Series Analysis 
* Technical Indicators and Charts 
* Theoretical Simulation for Finance

The Trading toolbox


These features can be used and adapted for developing trading algorithms in MATLAB.



####Algorithmic Trading

***Algorithmic*** trading or **algo** trading are trading systems implemented by complex mathematical formulas and high-speed, computer programs to determine trading strategies. These strategies use electronic platforms to enter trading orders with an algorithm which executes pre-programmed trading instructions accounting for a variety of variables such as timing, price, and volume. Algorithmic trading is widely used by investment banks, pension funds, mutual funds, and other buy-side (investor-driven) institutional traders, to divide large trades into several smaller trades to manage risk. 

Algo trading or automated trading is the backbone of *high frequency trading* (HFT), an approach that uses mathematical algorithms to place high volume of trades on very minute timescales. HFT is a recent trend in finance that has exploded in popularity so much so that in 20009 it is estimated that HFT accounted for 60-73% of all US equity trading volume. The surge in HFT is primarily due to the rise in popularity of algorithmic trading.



#####MATLAB and Algorithmic Trading

Builders and users of algorithmic trading applications need to develop, backtest, and deploy mathematical models that detect and exploit market movements. 


An effective workflow involves:


<pre><code>
for i=1:Nrealiz
    x=zeros(N,1);
    t=zeros(N,1);
    x(1)=x0; % initial condition
    t(1)=0;
    r=randn(N,1);
    for n=1:(N-1)
        x(n+1)=x(n)+nudt+sigsdt*r(n);
        t(n+1)=t(n)+dt;
    end
    Sv=exp(x);
    plot(t,Sv,'k-');
end
</code></pre>


    -Getting data from the web (yahoo, google, CBOE etc)
    -Aligning and filtering datasets
    -Nearest-neighbor classification
    -Designing & backtesting strategies
    -Interfacing with Interactive Brokers
    -Keeping track of strategy performance
