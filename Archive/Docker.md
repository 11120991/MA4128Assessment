Docker
===============================

 - Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: **code**, *runtime*, ***system tools***, `system libraries` â€“ anything you can install on a server. 
 - This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.
